				<h1> Alternatives to Self-Harm </h1>
			</div>
			<div class="profile-content-wrapper-altbod">
				<p style="margin-left:100px; margin-right:50px;">Before we start, we want to let you know that it is <b>completely</b> okay if it seems difficult to replace self harm with an alternative immediately. Take things one step at a time and at your own pace, and remind yourself that you are NOT alone in this relentless yet rewarding abstract that we call “Life”.</p>
				<p style="margin-left:100px; margin-right:50px;">From a scientific standpoint, we feel an urge to self harm because it releases endorphins in our body. It gives us a sense of relief or control over ourselves afterward, among other positive after-feelings.  Even if you have already heard this from your friends, family, or counselor, listen just one more time: cutting is an extremely harmful way of coping with negative emotions-- it may not seem too dangerous at first, and the long term consequences may seem negligible or inexistent, but you can <i>easily</i> get addicted to using the method. And once you are, the once “extreme extent” that you may have ruled out as “too far” before may actually manifest. But by then, it may be too late.   
				</p>
				<p style="margin-left:100px; margin-right:50px;">So, why choose cutting to release those endorphins when there are PLENTY of healthier AND safer methods for you to release pent up emotions just as much, and if not, more? 
				<br>Here are some easy things you can do those release endorphins in the same way:
				<ul style ="margin-left:100px">
					<li> Put an ice cube on your wrist (Yes it’s weird, but try it!) </li>
					<li>Do ten push-ups</li>
					<li>Go for a run</li>
					<li>Take a cold shower</li>
					<li>Do ten jumping-jacks</li>
					<li>Eat some <span style="color: brown">chocolate</span> or <span style="color: red">spicy food!</mark></li>
					<li>Meditate</li>
					<li>Smile (a random smile sets off the happy chemicals in your brain + lets you know if you have stuff stuck in  your teeth :D)</li>
					<li>Draw/Paint (I recommend Bob Ross)</li>
