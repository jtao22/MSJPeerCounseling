# MSJPeerCounseling
MSJHS Peer Counseling serves to facilitate 100% anonymous peer-to-peer support while providing a comforting space for students to simultaneously vent and uplift others. In other words, if you’re feeling stressed, depressed, frustrated, or if there is just anything you would like to get off of your chest, join our live chat or attend a scheduled live chat session to talk to another MSJ student about it! They’ll talk to you about their problems, and you’ll talk to them about yours. In this win-win situation, your identity will be kept anonymous to others, including website moderators- no one will know who you are, so you don’t have to worry about getting into trouble, being exposed, or receiving judgement!
The webpage is public through the use of two Netlify websites. The first one is a static website containing most of the pages. The second site contains the code for the live chat, which was coded using React, Node, and Socket.io. The frontend of the live chat is deployed on Netlify, the backend is run through Heroku.
